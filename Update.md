### Project Priorities

To ensure successful completion of this GSoC project, I've analyzed the project objectives and categorized implementation priorities based on their importance to Music Blocks users:

#### Fundamental Priorities (Must Have)
1. **Create a usable block execution system** - Users must be able to arrange blocks and have them correctly execute in sequence
2. **Support basic programming constructs** - Variables, loops, conditionals that work reliably
3. **Enable musical output** - Play notes and sequences with accurate timing
4. **Implement error reporting** - Provide clear feedback when programs have issues

These core capabilities form the essential foundation of Music Blocks and will be my primary focus to ensure a successful project outcome.

#### Secondary Priorities (Should Have)
1. **Support concurrent execution** - Allow multiple stacks to run simultaneously
2. **Enable function/procedure blocks** - Support reusable code with parameters
3. **Implement debugging capabilities** - Stepping, breakpoints, and state inspection
4. **Optimize performance** - Ensure smooth execution on typical hardware

These capabilities significantly enhance the user experience and I'm committed to implementing them after the fundamentals are solid.

#### Tertiary Priorities (Nice to Have)
1. **Advanced musical features** - Complex timing, polyrhythms, musical transformations
2. **Object-oriented capabilities** - Object creation and method invocation
3. **Event system** - Sophisticated event triggering and handling
4. **Performance analysis tools** - Runtime statistics and bottleneck identification

While valuable additions, these will be pursued only after higher-priority items are complete and functioning well.

   ##### AST vs Program Tree Separation

   The AST will be explicitly separated from the UI program tree:
      
   - AST contains only execution-relevant information
   - UI concerns (workspace coordinates, block colors, visual connections) are stored separately
   - Translation layer maintains bidirectional mapping between AST nodes and visual blocks
   - When visual blocks are manipulated, corresponding AST changes are validated before being applied

   ##### Node Connectivity and Validation

   Connectivity between nodes will be managed through:
      
   - Type validation system that verifies compatible connections
   - Socket interface definitions specifying allowed connections
   - Pre-connection validation hooks that run before nodes are connected
   - Post-connection validation to ensure structural integrity
      
   Example validation rules:
   - Value type compatibility (number cannot connect to boolean socket)
   - Structural constraints (loop body must be a block)
   - Semantic constraints (variable must be defined before use)

   ##### Change Monitoring

   AST modifications will be monitored through:
      
   - Observer pattern implementation with before/after change events
   - Transaction-based changes allowing atomic operations and rollback
   - Change record maintaining history for undo/redo operations
   - Validation hooks running on each change to maintain AST integrity

## Implementation Plan

My approach prioritizes delivering a working system for users first, then adding more advanced capabilities:

### Phase 1: Core Execution Model (Fundamental)
I'll build the basic execution system that can:
- Execute blocks in sequence
- Process mathematical operations
- Store and retrieve variable values
- Handle simple control structures (if/else, loops)

From a user perspective, this means being able to:
- Create basic programs by connecting blocks
- Store values in variables and use them in calculations
- Control program flow with conditions and repetition
- Get results from simple programs reliably

The technical implementation will include:
- A simple but extensible AST structure 
- Basic interpreter for sequential execution
- Variable storage and retrieval system
- Validation to prevent obvious errors

### Phase 2: Music Block Foundations (Fundamental)
Building on the core system, I'll implement:
- Note playing capability
- Timing mechanisms for musical sequences
- Basic musical parameters (pitch, duration, volume)

Users will now be able to:
- Create simple melodies by connecting note blocks
- Control the timing of musical sequences
- Adjust basic properties of musical notes

### Phase 3: Advanced Program Structures (Secondary)
Next, I'll expand the system to include:
- Function/procedure blocks with parameters
- Nested control structures
- Enhanced error reporting and recovery

This will enable users to:
- Create reusable musical patterns
- Build more complex logical structures
- Receive helpful feedback when things go wrong

### Phase 4: Concurrency and Timing (Secondary)
With the basics solid, I'll implement:
- Parallel execution capabilities
- Synchronization between parallel threads
- Enhanced timing control for musical precision

Users will now be able to:
- Create multi-part musical compositions
- Synchronize different musical elements
- Build more sophisticated musical structures

### Phase 5: Refinement and Extensions (Tertiary)
If time permits, I'll work on:
- Debugging tools for inspecting program execution
- Performance optimizations for complex programs
- Advanced musical capabilities

These will enhance the user experience by:
- Making it easier to understand and fix problems
- Enabling more complex compositions to run smoothly
- Providing more expressive musical capabilities

### Implementation Phases

Based on the prioritized needs of Music Blocks users, my implementation will proceed through these phases:

#### Phase 1: Fundamental User Experience
- Implement the core execution model for basic block sequencing
- Create the variable and mathematics system
- Build foundational music block capabilities

#### Phase 2: Programming Constructs
- Add control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Implement function definition and calling
- Enhance error reporting for user feedback

#### Phase 3: Musical Capabilities
- Enhance note and musical pattern support
- Implement timing and synchronization
- Add music-specific operation blocks

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Build concurrent execution capabilities
- Implement debugging and inspection tools
- Optimize performance for complex programs

#### Phase 5: Refinement and Extensions
- Address feedback from user testing
- Enhance documentation and examples
- Add extended musical capabilities
